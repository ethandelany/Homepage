    <p>I've been coding for 6 years. My interest started when I decided to code for my 5th grade Science Fair. I currently know four programming languages. In developing this website, I have used three of the four. I love to work on these things, so I code frequently. I am a Tech Manager for my high school, which means that I get to work on technical things all the time. I am currently certified in Level 2 DANTE. In regards to the technology I use, I heavily prefer audio setups as opposed to lighting or running. I built my own computer and I enjoy assisting others in building theirs.</p>
